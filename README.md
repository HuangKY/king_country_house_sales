## Project Introduction<a name="intro"></a>

I am interested in **what affects house price**, so I conducted an analysis based on the house price data from kaggle [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).

There are main three approach in the analysis:

1. Is the house price increasing ?
2. What factors correlate with the house price mostly?
3. Is it possible to tag a house as "cheap" or "expensive" ?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook and 1 dataset in the repository.
The notebook is the basis of the analysis report.
